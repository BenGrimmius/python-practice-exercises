Calculator Challenge Rules:
---------------------------
- Build a simple command-line calculator that:
  1. Asks the user to enter two numbers.
  2. Asks the user to choose an operation: +, -, *, or /.
  3. Performs the chosen operation and prints the result.
  4. Handles invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values, unsupported operations).
  5. Handles division by zero with an error message instead of crashing.
