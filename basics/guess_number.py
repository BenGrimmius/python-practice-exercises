Guess the Number Challenge Rules:
---------------------------------
- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 50.
- The player tries to guess the number.
- After each guess:
  1. If the guess is too high → print "Too high! Try again."
  2. If the guess is too low → print "Too low! Try again."
  3. If the guess is correct → print "Congratulations! You guessed it!"
- The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
- (Optional) Track the number of attempts and display it at the end.
